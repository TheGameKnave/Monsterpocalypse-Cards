# Monsterpocalypse-Cards

Experiment using CSS as desktop publishing to create cards as a game aid without having to mess around with illustrator or publisher.

Also experimented with form filtering for various game figure characteristics.

First draft of form filtering is visible at [gameknave.com/monpoc](http://gameknave.com/monpoc). Cards at this link are flat images, as rendering multiple cards on-demand was a resource problem.

To mirror the repo, make sure you're parsing .svg files through PHP, since the symbol colors are dictated by variables within the .svg file.

Known issue: card renderer slightly bit-rotted

todo: Clean up filtering, maybe port ro react.js
